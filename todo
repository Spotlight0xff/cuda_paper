measure performance:

overlapping:
* vectorAdd (?) simple func

zero-copy:
* comparing vectorAdd
* comparing matrix transpose (http://arrayfire.com/zero-copy-on-tegra-k1/)

global memory access:
* matrix multiplication ?

shared memory access:
* continue with example, dotproduct

advanced topics:
* memory divergence?
* cache hitrate
* texture cache
* occupancy
* latency hiding through parallelism
