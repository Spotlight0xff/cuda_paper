measure performance:

zero-copy:
* comparing vectorAdd

pinned memory:
* simple throughput example

global memory access:
* matrix multiplication ?

shared memory access:
* continue with example, dotproduct

advanced topics:
* memory divergence?
* cache hitrate
* texture cache
* occupancy
* latency hiding through parallelism
