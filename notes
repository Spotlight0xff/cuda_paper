introduction:
    * CPU <> GPU
    * CUDA framework
    * compute capability

hardware architecture:
    Overview:
        * host
        * device
        * SM
    Memory:
        Device:
            * global
            * shared
            * registers
            * local
            * L1
            * L2
        Transfer:
            * PCIe protocol characteristics
            * PCIe generation overview / comparison
            * comparison to global memory / device memory
    Kernel:
        * ??
        * threads/blocks/grid...?
memory management:
    allocation:
        dynamic allocation
        pitches layout
    streams and synchronization:
        synchronization:
        streams:
    Unified Virtual Addressing (UVA):
    Unified Memory
memory transfer optimization:
    pinned memory:
        portable:
        mapped:
        wcpm?:
    Zero-Copy:
Memory access optimization:
    global memory access:
        CC 1.x (Tesla):
        CC 2.x (Fermi):
        CC 3.x (Kepler):
        CC 5.x (Maxwell):
        2d access (pitched)
        * example code, show throughput table
    shared memory access:
        * shared memory fast, on-chip
        * configurable size, 64 kb
        * using 32 memory banks => high performance, different bandwith (CC related)
        * bank conflicts, diff CCs
        * example code, show throughput table
