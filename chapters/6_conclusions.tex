\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}
The discussed methods and techniques have shown how to transfer and access different kinds of memory efficiently.
Because we can compute and access data way faster on the device than transfer it to it, it is often better/more efficient
to do some calculations/computations on the device even if they don't get processed faster, but to avoid memory transfer.
This results in more GPU code and therefore higher complexity. (?)
