\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
CUDA is an API by NVIDIA to utilize GPUs for accelerated computation.
This Framework is currently in its 7th version and we will discuss it at this point in time.
GPUs have a different approach to computation, 
as they have far more cores and are therefore able to process code more concurrently.
To utlize this potential we have to pass data efficiently to the GPU and process it in a parallelized manner.
We will focus in this paper on the memory transfer and access optimization.
First, we have to understand the hardware architecture to recognize the possible limitations and bottlenecks.
After that, we will discuss some memory transfer optimization and then two memory access patterns.
