This paper discusses the basics of the CUDA Runtime and Development process.
It will furthermore introduce the reader into the CUDA hardware architecture and memory management. We will then explore some memory transfer and access optimization techniques.
Additionally, synchronization is briefly covered.
This paper is done as a pro seminar at the High Performance Computing at the RWTH Aachen in 2015.
