\subsection{Memory Allocation}
We need to differentiate the allocation of host and device memory.
While we can allocate host memory using malloc, but not exclusively, device memory is generally allocated using cudaMalloc.
\emph{cudaMalloc()} can allocate a linear memory in the device memory, given the device has enough free memory.
Important to note is that \emph{cudaMalloc()} is always blocking, as an alternative can cudaMallocAsync be used which uses streams (...?).


As we will see in the fifth chapter~\ref{sec:access}, 
it is important to access memory correctly and to simplify this, 
we can use \emph{cudaMallocPitch} and \emph{cudaMalloc3D()} to allocate 2D and 3D memory respectively.



Allocation and Deallocation are expensive operations and as a consequence we should reuse memory whereever it is possible.
(maybe show timings?)
